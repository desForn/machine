//This program with two stacks uses a single string to represent x#y.
//First it constructs w = (w_i)_{i < max(|x|, |y|)} where w_i = x_i + 3 * y_i (adding leading zeros
//if necessary).
//w is stored in the first stack with the least significant digit at the top.
//After reading the input, x and y are stored alongside in the first stack but aligned at the most
//significant digit (that is, the zeros are added as trailing zeros). The loop starting at state 6
//moves the shorter number (if |x| â‰  |y|) such that the numbers are aligned at the least significant
//digit when entering state 0.
//Then the digits are added and pushed at the second stack, with the most significant digit at the
//top. Finally, they are witten at the output.
