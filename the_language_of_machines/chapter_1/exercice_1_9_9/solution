A nondeterministic program computing a relation ρ may be defined as a program such that given x, the
program halts with output y only if xρy and for each y such that xρy there exists a valid
computation with output y.

A nondeterministic program computing a partial function may be defined using the previous
definition. That is, if x ∈ Dom(ρ), there exists y = xρ and a valid computation such that its output
is y. Furthermore, no valid computation exists with a different output. If ¬(x ∈ Dom(ρ)), then all
computations are blocking.
