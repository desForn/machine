Consider a queue over the alphabet Γ.
a) Its realm is Γ*
b) Its repertory is:
    enqueue c: α → αc
    dequeue c: cα → α
    empty: Λ → Λ
c) Formally the repertory is:
    For each c ∈ Γ, enqueue c = { (α, β) ∈ Γ* Χ Γ* | β = αc }
    For each c ∈ Γ, dequeue c = { (α, β) ∈ Γ* Χ Γ* | α = cβ }
    empty = { (Λ, Λ) }
