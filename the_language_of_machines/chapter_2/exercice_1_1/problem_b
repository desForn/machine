Theorem:
    The length of the b-adic representation of a number n is floor(log_b((b - 1)n + 1))

Proof:
    Denote the length of n by l(n).
    l is an increasing function.

    Consider the minimum number m of the same length than n.
    That is, a sequence of l(n) 1s.
    
        m = ∑_{i = 0}^{l(n) - 1}b^i = (b^(l(m)) - 1) / (b - 1)

        l(m) = log_b((b - 1)m + 1)

    As log_b is an increasing function and m ≤ n < b * m the result follows.
