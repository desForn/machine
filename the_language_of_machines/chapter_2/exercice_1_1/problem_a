Theorem:
    The length of the b-ary representation of a number n is 1 if n = 0 and floor(log_b(n) + 1)
    otherwise

Proof:
    Denote the length of n by l(n).
    l is an increasing function.

    Consider the minimum number m of the same length than n.
    That is, a 1 followed by l(n) - 1 zeros.
    
        m = b^(l(m) - 1)

        l(m) = log_b(m) + 1

    As log_b is an increasing function and m â‰¤ n < b * m the result follows.
